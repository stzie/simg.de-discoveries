Uncataloged HII rings and arcs. Some of these structures may be random, some
may be projections of spherical shells (bubbles). Such structures are always
circular in the image because stereographic projection was used. In the 
JavaScript Viewer the outlines of these structures are completed to circles. It
may be helpful to toggle these plots on a off by pressing the '2' key in order
to improve the visibility. 

[CA1](http://www.simg.de/nebulae3/tau-aur-per.html#ca1) is a huge HII region
that lies behind Molecular clouds in Taurus and Perseus because it is only
visible in the voids and less dense regions of these molecular clouds. The
brightest part is the California nebula (NGC 1499). Since the whole region has a
similar filamentary structure, it seems to belong together. The apparent
diameter is at least 24° (the width of the field of view).
