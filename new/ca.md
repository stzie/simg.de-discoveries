Uncataloged HII rings and arcs. Some of these structures may be random, some
may be projections of spherical shells (bubbles). Such structures are always
circular in the image because stereographic projection was used. In the 
JavaScript Viewer the outlines of these structures (all but CA1) are completed
to circles. It may be helpful to toggle these plots on a off by pressing the '2'
key in order to improve the visibility.
