# Old lists of of uncataloged objects

Previously uncataloged objects and objects related to them. Not all ones are
new, and not all of them (especially the arcs and bubbles) are real structures.

These lists are deprecated and no longer maintained. New lists with an improved
structure and clarified rules set are presented at 
<http://www.simg.de/catalog> and can be found in directory `../new2` of this
repository.

## Naming

The names used in this old lists consists in one or two letters and a number.
The first letter depend on the image or view in which the object was first
found, e.g., "A" stands for objects found in the image "Orion region". A second
"A" denotes possible rings or arcs, e.g., "AA" for rings or arcs in the "Orion
region".
