Objects that are not cataloged by now and objects the are related to them.

FA1 to FA3 are possible rings and arcs. Some of these structures may be random,
some may be projections of spherical shells (bubbles). Such structures are
always circular in the image because stereographic projection was used. In the 
JavaScript Viewer the outlines of these structures are completed to circles. It
may be helpful to toggle these plots on a off by pressing the '2' key in order
to improve the visibility. 

[F1](http://www.simg.de/nebulae3/mon-gem.html#f1) is a large HII region which
contains the Seagull Nebula (at least the body) and various other emission
Nebula, at least SH2-295 to SH2-297. That region is ionized by the CMa OB1
association and it lies in a distance of about 1000pc (=3261 light years).
