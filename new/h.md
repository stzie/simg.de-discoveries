Objects that are not cataloged by now. The list does not contain objects that
are only minor extensions of known structures.

[H1](http://www.simg.de/nebulae3/tau-ari-per.html#h1) is a huge HII region
that lies behind Molecular clouds in Taurus and Perseus because it is only
visible in the voids and less dense regions of these molecular clouds. The
brightest part is the California nebula (NGC 1499). Since the whole region has a
similar filamentary structure, it seems to belong together. The apparent
diameter is about 35° x 24°.
