Uncataloged HII rings and arcs. Some of these structures may be random, some
may be projections of spherical shells (bubbles). Such structures are always
circular in the image because stereographic projection was used. In the 
JavaScript Viewer the outlines of these structures are completed to circles. It
may be helpful to toggle these plots on a off by pressing the '2' key in order
to improve the visibility.

HII arcs near Zeta Cassiopeiae, a star hot enough to ionize hydrogen. The outer
arc can be more or less completed to a ring. There might be a bubble and Zeta
Cassiopeiae is close its surface. In this case the arcs we see consist in
ionized hydrogen collected by the expanding bubble. Because Zeta Cassiopeiae is
very close (about 180 pc or 590 light years) that bubble would be quite near.

The mentioned structures are faint and thus best visible in the H-alpha version
of the image. It may be helpful to toggle plots on and off by pressing the '2'.
