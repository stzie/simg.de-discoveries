Object K1a has been recorded at a different wavelength in the past. What is new, 
however, is that this object is an OIII emitter. 

Objects K2-K5 are small nebulae which are bright in [OIII] and that are not yet
listed at SIMBAD or the Planetary nebulae database . Most likely this are
planetary nebulae.
