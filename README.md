# Discoveries at [www.simg.de](http://www.simg.de)

This repository contains astronomical discoveries made using the images at
[www.simg.de](http://www.simg.de).

These images can be viewed using a JavaScript viewer with extensive analytical
features, like:

  * Measurements (e.g. position, angular distance and diameter, position angle)
  * Different [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) queries 
  * plotting catalog objects
  * User defined objects


## Structure an naming

Currently there is not much structure in this repository because it only
contains some objects that cannot be found in catalogs. These objects got a name
which consists in one or two letters and a number. The letters depend from the
image or view in which the object was found first, e.g. "A" stands for objects
found in the image "Orion region". A second letter "A" denotes possible rings or
arcs, e.g. "AA" for rings or arcs in the "Orion region".

Discoveries are described in the files in directory `new` in form of Markdown
documents.


## Is something missing?

Feel free to add (per pull request) new objects, corrections to discovered
objects and/or catalog objects.
