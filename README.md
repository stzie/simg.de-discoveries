# Discoveries at <http://www.simg.de>

This repository contains astronomical discoveries made using the images at
<http://www.simg.de>.

These images can be viewed using a JavaScript viewer with extensive analytical
features, such as:

  * Measurements (e.g., position, angular distance, diameter, and position angle)
  * Different [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) queries 
  * plotting catalog objects
  * User-defined objects

## Structure

There are two catalogs of previously uncatalogued objects. 

The old version in the directory `new` of this repository is ordered by the
images in which the objects were found. These lists are deprecated and no longer
maintained.

New lists with an improved structure and clarified rules set are presented at 
<http://www.simg.de/catalog> and can be found in directory `../new2` of this
repository.

## Is something missing?

Feel free to add new objects, corrections to discovered objects, and/or catalog
objects via a pull request.
