# Possible uncataloged bubbles

Possible bubbles that were detected in emission line images. Some of these
structures may be random; some may be projections of spherical bubbles and
might have been formed by supernovae or stellar winds.

The structures are sometimes difficult to see in the highly dynamic range
compressed images. In the JavaScript viewer, it may be helpful to toggle the
plots on and off by pressing the '2' key to improve visibility.

to images and <http://www.simg.de/catalog> for a general description of this
catalog.
