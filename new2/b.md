# Possible uncataloged bubbles

Possible bubbles that were detected in emission line images. Such bubbles are
usually formed by (ancient) supernovae.

The structures are sometimes difficult to see in the highly dynamic range
compressed images. In the JavaScript viewer, it may be helpful to toggle the
plots on and off by pressing the '2' key to improve visibility.

Visit <http://www.simg.de/catalog/b.html> for a version of this table with links
to images and <http://www.simg.de/catalog> for a general description of this
catalog.
