# List of of uncataloged objects

Previously uncatalogued objects and objects related to them. Not all objects are
new, and some of them (namely the bubbles) may not even be real structures.

This object list is a merged, revised, and improved version of an earlier
attempt to catalog unknown objects. The old version can be found in directory
`../new` of this repository. The new version is described in detail at
<http://www.simg.de/catalog>.

## Naming

The new list is divided into three categories, resulting in three files:

* `h.md`: Objects that are bright in H-alpha, mostly HII regions
* `o.md`: Objects that are bright in OIII / Planetary nebula candidates
* `b.md`: Possible bubbles detected in emission line images
